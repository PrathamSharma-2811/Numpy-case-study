# Numpy-case-study
 Dive into a NumPy case study: Synthetic dataset simulating movie reviews by N users for M movies, rating 1-10, with std deviation and sorting. User base: 1301-2301, movie IDs: 1-100, 50 extra movies and users. NumPy used for efficient processing
Explore an in-depth NumPy case study where I generated a synthetic dataset from scratch, simulating user reviews for movies. ðŸ“Š The dataset includes N users randomly reviewing M movies, assigning K ratings between 1 to 10, with a standard deviation calculation for ratings and sorting movies from lowest to highest rated. ðŸŽ¬ With a user base ranging from 1301 to 2301 and movie IDs spanning from 1 to 100, I extended the dataset by incorporating 50 additional movies and users, randomly rating any movie. ðŸ’¡ Leveraging NumPy's array manipulation capabilities, I efficiently processed the data, resulting in a comprehensive matrix containing movie ratings, their standard deviations, and a sorted list based on ratings.
